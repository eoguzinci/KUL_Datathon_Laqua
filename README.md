# KUL_Datathon_Laqua
This repository holds the workflow of the team L'Aqua for the KU Leuven Datathon 2020.

# The three data cases considered are [(weblink)](https://lstat.kuleuven.be/Datathon2020/data):
1. Telraam
2. LeuvenAir
3. Garmon

## Visualization

In `glocation.py`, you will see the location of each sensor from all the datasets. Sensors are colored as:

* Telraam: the midpoint of the cameras at each segment is labeled blue
* LeuvenAir: red
* Garmon: green

In order to see Google Maps figure, you first need to write this code in your terminal:

`jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps`

and then make sure in your terminal you get "validating ok" in your terminal.
